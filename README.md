In this application, I use state, props, context, global state, react-router-dom, fetching data, nested routes, search params, query strings. also I use a data base and back end files.
I also added leaflet package to show locations in a map. It needs some presets in index.html. By using some components from this library, it shows all the places. and by clicking one of the hotels, the center of the map will change.
